# Whitepaper on Singapore Open-source Self-driving Car
Mission: To build a life-sized vehicle capable of completing the Land Transport Authority's test track

Currently looking for:
1. Contributors
People to contribute code for models on perception, localisation, planning and decison making. If you are Singapore (or willing to fly down), would love help on the vehicle kinematics and hardware too.

2. Vehicle OEMs willing to sponsor a vehicle and dedicate an engineering team to helping us 'hack' on the vehicle controls
Fretting that your company behind on the self-driving car game? Instead of throwing billions at forming a dedicated team, your next best option is to prove that an open-source model works perfectly on your car. (think the Android for autonomous vehicles)

3. Autonomous vehicle hardware and solution startups wanting a POC
Need a partner to test your product and give you a proof of concept, so that you can focus on what you do best on perfecting your product instead of wasting resources on building a test vehicle? Work with us! We love your cutting-edge stuff.
